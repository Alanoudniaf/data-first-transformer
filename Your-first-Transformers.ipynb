The goal of this challenge is to introduce you to these models for the first time and show how easy they can be to work with.\n","\n","### Why you should love HuggingFace:\n","\n","#### Pre-trained Models 📚:\n","\n","One of the best features of the Transformers library is its huge repo of pre-trained models. Whether you're looking to employ BERT, GPT-2, T5, RoBERTa, or any of the other transformer architectures, chances are you'll find a version that suits your needs in their model hub.\n","\n","#### It's super easy 👍:\n","\n","The library is designed to be user-friendly. Loading a model and its corresponding tokenizer can be done in just a couple of lines of code. This simplicity extends to fine-tuning as well, allowing you to adapt these powerful models to a wide range of tasks. The `pipelines` library we'll be using lets you go from model selection to getting results in just a few lines.\n","\n","#### Tokenizer  🔄 and Datasets 📊 Library:\n","\n","Alongside the Transformers library, HuggingFace also offers the Tokenizers and Datasets libraries. While the first provides efficient and easy-to-use tokenization methods, the second offers a whole bunch of datasets, meaning you have all the tools and data you need in one ecosystem.\n","\n","#### Community-Driven 🌐:\n","The HuggingFace community is very active and any community member (you included) can upload their own models and datasets."],"id":"U_jXX6GaW6dP"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KkmuxZUKW6dT"},"source":["__If you are working in Colab__ you'll need to install the appropriate libraries in your Colab
